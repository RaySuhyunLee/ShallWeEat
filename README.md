# ShallWeEat

## Iteration 4

the source code is inside ShallWeEat/ShallWeEat/ directory.

You can run the server by using commands below
```
bundle install
bin/rake db:migrate
bin/rails s
```


You can access in the web browser by connecting via http://localhost:3000/suggestions/questions

If you answers all the questions, the food information view will appear. When you press the good or bad button, it will send the feedback to the server and go back to the question view. We didn't add any food image yet, so you would not see the image.
